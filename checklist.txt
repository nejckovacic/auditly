Verify the sticky navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the viewport and includes the product name, main product image, links to key page sections, availability status, original price, discounted price (with percentage or currency savings), and the primary CTA button; ensure the bar hides when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up.  
Confirm the product page provides a clear customer‐inquiry mechanism, such as a live chat widget or a prominently displayed phone number, so potential buyers can ask questions in real time.  
Check that breadcrumb navigation is present (unless the store is single‐product or a direct‐response landing page), enabling users to trace their path back through category or search pages.  
Ensure there is an email signup form on out‐of‐stock products so visitors can submit their address and receive automatic notifications when the item restocks.  
Test that clicking the browser’s back button reliably returns users to the exact page they came from, preserving any filters or search parameters.  
Verify that a concise product overview summary appears above the CTA area, giving a snapshot of the most important details before the call‑to‑action.  
Confirm the main product title is descriptive—clearly stating the item’s key attributes—and is visually prominent compared to surrounding text.  
Check the product title length is under 65 characters so it displays fully in Google search results without truncation.  
Ensure the product subtitle highlights a key benefit using at least one “power word” (e.g. effortless, exclusive, new, secret, why) to grab attention.  
Confirm that a product‐rating overview (e.g. “4.6 ★ – Read 5 Reviews”) is displayed near the main title and links to detailed customer reviews via click or scroll.  
Verify a short, bullet‑style list of additional key benefits appears adjacent to the main title, with each item linked (e.g. via anchor) to its corresponding detailed section and visually marked (e.g. with green check icons).  
Check that the main product photo is high‑quality and visually appealing, creating a strong first impression.  
Ensure the main product image supports easy zooming—especially on mobile devices—so users can inspect details.  
Confirm a dedicated image gallery exists showing multiple angles or variants of the product.  
Verify the gallery displays clickable thumbnails of all available images beneath or beside the main photo.  
Ensure the gallery includes product videos (e.g. embedded MP4 or YouTube/Vimeo).  
Check for next/previous navigation arrows within the gallery to move between images without leaving the page.  
On mobile, confirm the gallery supports swipe gestures to navigate through images.  
Verify that variant‑specific images (e.g. different colors or sizes) appear automatically when users select a variant.  
Ensure the main CTA button (“Add to Cart” or similar) is the most visually prominent element on the page and includes a cart icon.  
Confirm that variant selection controls (color swatches, size buttons) are large enough with ample whitespace on mobile to prevent mis‑taps.  
Test that selecting a product variant updates the main image and price in real time without a full page reload.  
Verify a visible reminder appears if a user clicks “Add to Cart” without first selecting a required variant (e.g. size or color).  
Check that quantity selectors use interactive controls (e.g. +/– buttons) rather than dropdowns, and that quantity changes update price dynamically without reloading.  
Ensure a link to a size chart (or embedded popup) is placed near size selections, opens in a small modal, and is easily dismissed on mobile.  
Confirm that all size and weight units are localized (e.g. cm/inches, kg/lbs) based on the user’s locale.  
For apparel, verify the product description indicates the model’s height and the size they are wearing.  
Check the CTA copy clearly explains what happens when clicked (e.g. “Proceed to secure checkout”).  
Ensure clear feedback appears once a product is added to the cart (e.g. mini‑cart count increments, button text changes).  
Verify the primary CTA button text temporarily changes (e.g. to “✔ Product added” for 2 seconds, then “Go to my cart →”).  
Confirm the product price is prominently displayed near the main CTA, with special styling if discounted.  
Ensure localized currency formatting appears (e.g. “€19.99” for European users).  
Check that any additional costs (shipping surcharges, VAT) are displayed near the CTA.  
If free shipping is offered, verify that “Free shipping” is highlighted close to the CTA.  
Ensure full shipping details (destination, cost, estimated time, country flag) are shown near the CTA.  
Verify current availability status (“In stock”, “Only 2 left”) is displayed near the main CTA.  
For sale items, confirm the original price is struck through next to the new price and savings percentage.  
Ensure clear return, refund, and money‑back guarantee information is provided near the primary CTA.  
Verify popular express payment options (PayPal, Amazon Pay, Google Pay, Apple Pay) are displayed and selectable.  
For high‑value items, confirm an installment payment option (e.g. Klarna, AfterPay) is available.  
Check that logos of major press outlets, celebrity endorsements, or “Used by Fortune 500” badges are showcased for social proof.  
Verify customer reviews display a title, star rating, reviewer photo, reviewer name, “Verified Buyer” tag, occupation, and age.  
Ensure reviews stand out visually (e.g. highlighted background) and can be filtered by star rating.  
Confirm photo‑based customer testimonials (real customers using the product) are present.  
Check the page displays total units sold (e.g. “19,222 shipped this month”) and can update in real time.  
Verify embedded video testimonials (e.g. mp4 or embedded social posts) are present.  
Ensure follower counts (Facebook, Twitter) are shown if applicable.  
Confirm clear quantity discount tiers are offered (e.g. “1× €24.99, 2× €19.99, 3× €17.49” with badges “Recommended” or “Best value”).  
Verify relevant cross‑sell or up‑sell product suggestions appear below the main CTA.  
Ensure bundle offers with prominent discounts are displayed.  
Check urgency triggers (e.g. “Today only”, countdown timers) are placed near the CTA.  
Verify scarcity messages (e.g. “Only 3 left”) appear near the CTA when stock is low.  
Ensure “Visitors who viewed this product also viewed…” recommendations are present for related/alternative products.  
Confirm the product description area uses easy‑to‑read typography (75 chars per line, line‑height 1.5, max 4 lines).  
Verify product details are structured in bullet points with highlighted benefits.  
Check long sections (e.g. “General”, “Technical Info”) are collapsible accordions, easy to scan on mobile.  
Ensure section headings focus on benefits (not just features).  
Confirm a list or images of all items included in the purchase (e.g. box contents).  
Verify product‑specific FAQs and site‑wide FAQs are included.  
Ensure technical specification tables are readable (hover states, alternating row shading).  
Check that users can compare this product against similar items via a comparison table or selector.  
Confirm the description includes “How to use” in 3 simple steps.  
Verify embedded social screenshots (Facebook post, Tweet, Instagram message) appear as additional proof.
